    <h1>Que 1</h1>
    <h3> Explain call apply bind method and give an example of call apply bind</h3>
    Call is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In layperson's terms, it helps you replace the value of this inside a function with whatever value you want.

    Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.
    
    Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context of this that is provided.
 <h2>Que 2</h2>
 <h3>what is object in javascript ?</h3>
 const student = {
    fName: "Harsh",
    lName: "Gujral",
    profession: "Comedian",
    31: "Age",
    displayInfo: function(){
        console.log (`The first name of the student is ${student.fName} and the last name is ${student.lName}
        and its profession is ${student.profession} and its age is ${student[31]}`);
    }
}
<h2>que 3</h2>
<h3>what are the objects</h3>
Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects
<h2>que 4</h2>
<h3>what are function constructor</h3>
The Function() constructor creates a new Function object.The Function constructor creates functions which execute in the global scope only.
 <h2>que 4</h2>
 <h3>explain prototype</h3>
 <p id="demo"></p>
  To add new properties (or methods) to all existing objects of a given type.Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to an object constructor.
  Using the prototype  property allows you to add new properties to object constructors:

  <h2>Que 5</h2>
  <h3>what is prototype chaining</h3>
  let myArr = [1,2,3,4,5];
 let myNewArr = new Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
console.log(myArr.__proto__);
console.log(myArr.__proto__.__proto__);
console.log(myArr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__);

  <h2>Que 6</h2>
  <h3>give an example of inheritance using function</h3>
  // parent class
class Person { 
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
    }
}

// inheriting parent class
class Student extends Person {

}

let student1 = new Student('Jack');
student1.greet();

<h2>Que 7</h2>
<h3>what are callbacks</h3>
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

<h2>Que 8</h2>
<h3>what is the use of SetTimeOut</h3>
The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.

<h2>Que 9</h2>
<h3>what is an event loop and call stack</h3>
Event Loop: Then comes the Event Loop, which keeps running continuously and checks the Main stack, if it has any frames to execute, if not then it checks Callback queue, if Callback queue has codes to execute then it pops the message from it to the Main Stack for the execution.
call stack:Stack: This is where all your javascript code gets pushed and executed one by one as the interpreter reads your program, and gets popped out once the execution is done. If your statement is asynchronous: setTimeout, ajax(), promise, or click event, then that code gets forwarded to Event table, this table is responsible for moving your asynchronous code to callback/event queue after specified time.
